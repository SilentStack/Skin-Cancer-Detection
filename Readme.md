# Skin Cancer Detection using ML 
This project aims to detect skin cancer using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of different types of skin lesions.

## Tech Stack 
Python, TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## How It Works
Preprocesses images (resizing, normalization).
Trains a CNN model to classify skin lesions.
Evaluates accuracy and performance.

--> Dataset available from Kaggle of 2.9GB https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
paste it in images folder.

## Results
Achieved 85% accuracy on test data.
Can classify multiple skin lesion types.
